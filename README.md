# Summer Guild

Summer Guild is a one-week program that introduces rising freshmen and sophomore underrepresented students at CUNY to digital product development with the goal of sparking their interest in studying computer science. The program provides students with a hands-on experience of the product development lifecycle, while also introducing them to coding and AI tools. In just one-week, students are able to brainstorm a product idea, and showcase their website.

Offered through the CUNY Tech Equity initiative and delivered by Floreo Labs, the program empowers students to build real-world, mission-driven websites while gaining exposure to industry tools and professionals.

*We welcome all students from underrepresented groups in tech to participate in our programs, regardless of race or gender.*
